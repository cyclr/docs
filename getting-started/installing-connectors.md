title: Installing Connectors

In order to use Cyclr, you need to install connectors for your apps.

To do this, make sure you are in the builder (click to create a cycle) and then click the Add Connector button in the right sidebar of the builder.

When you install a connector, you will need to authenticate it in order to allow Cyclr to connect. If you’re just experimenting, you can skip this step.

#### Authenticate a connector

There are different types of authentication. Depending on the connector you wish to use, the application may require any of the following:

*   Oauth – login using your account and give permissions
*   An API key
*   Username and password
*   No authentication, e.g. for webhooks

The connector installer will take you through the steps in order to authenticate.

Once you have authenticated your connectors, you will be returned to the builder. Your new connectors will be installed in the sidebar ready to use.

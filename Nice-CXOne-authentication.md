## Nice CXOne setup

### Register Application

To setup up the Nice CXOne connector, you need to register an Application. You can find Nice CXOne's guide to do this [here](https://developer.niceincontact.com/Documentation/ApplicationRegistration).

### Get an Access Key ID and Access Key Secret

To authenticate the Nice CXOne connector, you need to:
- Register an Application to receive a Client ID and Client Secret.
- Get an Access Key ID and Access Key Secret.


Obtain an Access Key ID and Access Key Secret by:

1. Select Profile in the right corner of the CXone top navigation bar.

2. Select **My Profile** from the drop-down.

3. Select **Access Keys**. 
4. Select **Add Access Key**.

> **Note**: You can only view the **Secret Access Key** while you are in the My Profile window. Once you exit the window, you will no longer be able to view the Secret Key.

If you have any trouble obtaining an Access Key ID and Access Key Secret, follow [this guide](https://help.nice-incontact.com/content/globalfeatures/myprofile/myprofile.htm) or contact your Nice CXOne account manager.

## Cyclr Templates

You can build Templated integrations in Cyclr that can then be either manually installed to your client's account or offered to clients for self-installation.

When you select the 'Design New Template' option from within Templates>Template Library you will be taken directly to Cyclr's builder tool.  In order to keep your Cyclr's console tidy and well organised the first thing that you are recommended to do is to give the Template a good name.

Once you have at least one Template built or in-progress then you will see these shown in a list view when you go to the Template Library. Options against each of the Templates in the list allow you to:

| Option | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Edit | You will be taken to Cyclr's integration builder with the most recent draft selected Template loaded. |
| Releases | Templates in Cyclr can be versioned (see below) |
| Delete | Removes the Template.  This will NOT affect instances of the Template that have been installed in any of your Client's Accounts. |
| Private/Public | If you want to make the Template available for installation by one of your Clients the setting must be Public.  Leaving the setting as private means that the Template is under construction or is generally not ready for publication. |

## Tagging Templates

You can add Tags to your Templates through the list view.  These Tags are used by LAUNCH to choose which Templates are presented to a specific client.  The LAUNCH API call can request that only Templates tagged in a particular way are presented for installation.

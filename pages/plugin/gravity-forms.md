#### Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the following things in place before you begin.

*   WordPress with Gravity Forms installed
*   Admin access to install WordPress plugins
*   A Cyclr account
*   Cyclr [Gravity Forms Plugin](https://cyclr.com/integrate/gravity-forms-plugin) connector installed

#### Download

Once you have confirmed the above, you can download our Gravity Forms plugin.

[Download Cyclr Gravity Forms Plugin](http://files.cyclr.com/cyclr-plugins/cyclr-webhooks.zip)

#### Installation

1.  In WordPress, click Plugins and then Add New
2.  On the Add Plugins page, click Upload Plugin
3.  Locate the zip file for the plugin on your computer and upload it

Once those steps are complete, you are ready to setup the plugin.

#### Get your webhook’s URL from Cyclr

*   Create a cycle and install the Gravity Forms Plugin connector
*   Click/drag the Form Entry step into the builder
*   Click the cog icon on the step and copy the webhook’s URL to your clipboard; this is where your form will post its data

#### Set up Gravity Forms

*   In Gravity Forms, open your form for editing
*   Add a new hidden field to your form named **WebhookUrl**
*   On the field’s Advanced tab, set the Default Value to be the webhook URL generated by your step in Cyclr

**Note**: If you are using Conditional Logic to show/hide fields, make sure you added the hidden field **WebhookUrl **above all fields which have Conditional Logic. It is recommended to add **WebhookUrl **to the very top of your form.

#### Set up custom fields in Cyclr

Cyclr will not know about the fields you’ve added to your form by default. You will need to add these in Cyclr.

The simplest way is to make a dummy submission of your form after having clicked the Field Discovery button on your Form Entry Step in your cycle.  This will cause Cyclr to wait for a submission to arrive which will then be parsed to create new Custom Fields.

To manually add Fields or to change existing ones, follow these steps:
*   In the builder, open the connector in the sidebar and click the Settings button
*   Under Methods & Fields, pop open the Entries category and then the Form Entry webhook

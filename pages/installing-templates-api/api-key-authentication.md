_**For connectors that are authenticated using an API key provided by the 3rd party app.**_

Your userâ€™s API Key will need to be collected in your application and sent to Cyclr like below, this can be done for both unauthenticated and authenticated connectors.

Request:

````http
    PUT /v1.0/account/connectors/{Account Connector ID}
    Authorization Bearer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

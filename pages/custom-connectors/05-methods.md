## Settings

These are descriptions of the API endpoints in a standard format.

| Property | Description | Standards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | The name of the method to appear in the Cyclr UI for the user to see. | Should be short and snappy and have initial caps for nouns/verbs, lowercase for minor words (like “a” or “to”), e.g. “Delete Emails”, “Get All Contacts”, “Send to List”.  See below for suggested naming conventions. |
| Description | This is the description of the method to appear in the Cyclr UI for the user to understand what the method does and be informed of any special/interesting values to pass. | Can be quite lengthy if appropriate. Can also include links to helpful API documentation if useful.|
| Warning | | |
| Status | | |
| Comments | | |
| Category | Used to group methods in the Cyclr UI. | Try to keep to single, pluralized words, e.g. “Emails” or “Contacts”.|
| Subcategory | | |
| MethodType | This defines where the method will appear in the Cyclr UI: Action, Webhook or Script. | |
| HttpMethod | This is the action to be performed on the API method. Supported methods are GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE. | |
| Endpoint | This is the URI to the API method. Not used if this Method Type is a webhook.| |
| Hide | This will hide the method in the Cyclr UI if set to true. |
| DataType | This is the data type used by the API, either Json, Xml, or Form. For GET, this is the Accept header. For POST, this is the request data. JSON is our recommended data type. Read more about [data types](./data-types)| |
| Xml Root Element | If using XML, this it the single root element for the XML document.| |

Connector naming conventions.

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | 
| Get (ObjectNameSingular) | Used when the method retrieves a single object. |
| List (ObjectNamePlural)| Used when the method retrieves multiple objects. |
| Create (ObjectNameSingular) | Used when the method creates an object. |
| Create  (ObjectNamePlural) | Used when the method creates multiple objects from a single call. |
| Delete (ObjectNameSingular) | Used when the method deletes an object. |
| Update (ObjectNameSingular) | Used when the method updates an object. |

## Rate Limits

You can specify rate limits that apply to this method alone.

## Request Format / Response Format

Here you specify the request or response message format Fields. Note that if these are generated from a sample payload using the Generate Fields button, you will first need to select a Data Type (JSON, XML etc).

| Property | Description | Standards |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Connector Field | The name of the field as used by the remote application’s API. Use Cyclr notation to locate the value, e.g. _[records].EmailAddress_ when receiving an array and retrieving the _EmailAddress _attribute from an element within that array (see _RequestFormat / ResponseFormat_ documentation). | |
| System Field | The name to use internally within Cyclr. Use the field as capitalised by the API and remove any spaces. Apps that have the same SystemField name can auto match values in the builder, saving time and making life easier.| |
| Display Name | The name of the field to be displayed in the Cyclr UI to the user. | |
| Description | This is the description of the Field to appear in the Cyclr UI for the user to understand how the Field is used. | Always include this and keep fairly short (no more than 100 characters). |
| Optional | Set to `true` if the Field doesn’t have to be given a value. Leave out if it’s a required Field. | |
| Data Type | Options are: Text, Integer, Float, Boolean, DateTime, File, Decimal.  If the type is DateTime then a Format can be entered to specify the format.  Read more about [data types](./data-types) | |
| Default Value | | |

## Parameters

You can specify Parameters specific to this method. Read more about [parameters](./connector-parameters)

## Script

You can add script to the connector to handle special situations. All data flow should be handled in this section if Script is chosen as the Method Type. Read more about [scripting](./connector-scripting)

#### Sciprt Method Type
The script method type can be used for methods that do not make an external API call (e.g. static data), or where requests will need to be handled entirely by the script engine.

## Mergefields

Mergefields are placeholders that will be substituted at runtime.
  * LastSuccessfulRunDate – is the last time a Step successfully ran. This is useful to find newly created or updated records in an app. A format string needs to be provided. For example, _{% raw %}{{LastSuccessfulRunDate format=yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ}}{% endraw %}_.

### Sub Accounts

Within your customers' Accounts, it's now possible to set up **Sub Accounts**.

Sub-Accounts are a way of organising multiple related accounts.

You may for example want an account for a bookstore chain, and a sub-account for each location.

Each account will have access to any installed connectors in its *parent* account.

#### Setting up a Sub-Account

To set up a Sub-Account you would:

1. Go to **Console** > **Accounts** > **Account Management**

2. Identify the **Account** within which you wish to make a **Sub-Account**.  In the **Sub Accounts** column for this Account, click the number of **Sub Accounts** (this will likely be 0).

3. Click **Add New Sub Account**.

4. You can now set up a **Sub Account** just as you would any **Account**.

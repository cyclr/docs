When you install a template into an account, Cyclr:

* Adds the required account connectors with the same releases the template uses.
* Creates a cycle that's an exact copy of the template so each step uses the same release as its matching step in the template.

## Connector installation

If you have an existing account connector of the same type as the template, Cyclr uses the existing connectors by default but adds the same steps from the template.

You can use the account connectors from the template instead. Open the template, go to **Settings** > **Connector Installation** and select **Fresh Installation** from the dropdown.

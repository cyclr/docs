## Authentication ##

Authentication with LeadMailbox is very simple.  When the connector is installed you will need to provide the name of your account only.

## Post Leads Method

When the Post Leads method is called additionally you will need to provide the name of the Campaign to which the lead should be added.  You can check these values by:

From the LeadMailbox dashboard, click 
1. ``Settings``
2. ``Campaigns``
3. [``The Name of your Campaign``]
4. ``Show Post Url``

This shows the values to be used for both the Account Name and the Campaign Name.

### Configuring Custom Fields

### Setup your Custom Fields within Chargebee:

1. Go to your **Chargebee Site**

      **Field Label**: Text that will appear on the UI for hosted pages and invoices.
      **API Name**: Field reference for API calls and merges.

The custom fields are considered 'active', and will now be available only on the test site.

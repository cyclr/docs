# Setup

## API Key

To authenticate the SuperPhone connector you will need an API Key. This can be found towards the bottom of the settings page of your SuperPhone account, or by following [this link](https://app.superphone.io/settings/public-api-key).

When you first get started you need to generate an API key. You can revoke or regenerate your API Key at any time. To copy the API key, just click the copy icon next to it:

## Zenoti setup

To authenticate the connector, your customer needs an API key. 

To generate an API key, go to the Zenoti account and select **Admin** > **Setup** > **Apps**.

## Cyclr account setup

Cyclr asks you to enter the API key when you install the Zenoti connector into an account. 

> **Note**: You can use different API keys for different accounts.

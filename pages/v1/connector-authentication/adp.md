## Partner Setup

You will need to retrieve your client ID and secret. The client ID is set during account creation, and the secret is the password to the created account.

You will need to contact ADP support if you are not able to retrieve these details.

### Cyclr Setup

Setup your ADP App within Cyclr:

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **ADP**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Client ID**: The consumer application's account identifier, assigned during account registration.

**Client Secret**:  The consumer application's account password, assigned during account registration.


Your ADP Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

# WaiverForever setup

To authenticate the WaiverForever connector, you will need a valid `API Key`.

To obtain an `API Key` and authenticate the connector, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Log into the WaiverForever web UI
Log into the WaiverForever web frontend, and find the integrations section in settings (found [here](https://app.waiverforever.com/settings/integrations)).
### 2. Create an application key
At the bottom of this page, click `Generate New Application Key`.
### 3. Enter API details
Enter an "App Name" and "Description" and click `Create`.
### 4. Authenticate connector with new `API Key`
Copy the newly generated `API Key`, and enter this into your connector set-up.


Your WaiverForever Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

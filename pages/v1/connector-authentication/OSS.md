# OSS setup
To authenticate the OSS connector, you will need a valid `X-Token` and base `URL`.
To obtain these, please follow the steps below:
### 1. Retrieve a valid `X-Token`
Request a valid `X-Token` from the partner.
### 2. Retrieve a valid `URL`
Get a valid `URL` for the desired instance. This will be the base `URL` only, as shown in this example: `https://test.be-fibre.co.uk/api`.
### 3. Authenticate connector with `X-Token`
Copy the provided `X-Token`, and enter this into your connector set-up.
Next, copy the desired `URL`, and enter this into the connector set-up too.

Your OSS Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

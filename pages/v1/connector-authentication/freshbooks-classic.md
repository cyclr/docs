## Authentication ##

Freshbooks Classic uses basic authentication.  For this, you will need your Authentication Token.

## Finding your authentication token

You can find your authentication token by:

1. Going to your freshbooks page (https://[yoursubdomain].freshbooks.com
2. Clicking "Profile" at the top
3. Scrolling down to the "API Access" section.

## Authenticating the connector

You can then authenticate your connector by entering your Authentication Token in the "Username" field, and a single letter X in the Password field.

Your subdomain is whatever comes before freshbooks in your freshbooks web address.  So if your address is johnsmith.freshbooks.com, the subdomain will be johnsmith

# Farmers AGP Setup
To authenticate the Farmers AGP connector, you will need a valid `Vendor ID` and `Vendor Token`. You will also need a base `URL` for the instance.
To authenticate the connector, please follow the steps below:
### 1. Retrieve valid credentials
Request a valid `Vendor ID` and `Vendor Token` from the partner.
### 2. Retrieve a valid `URL`
Get a valid `URL` for the desired instance. This will be the base `URL` only, as shown in this example: `https://vendor-api.staging.farmerscrc.com`.
### 3. Authenticate connector with the credentials and URL
Copy the provided base `URL`, and enter this into your connector set-up, in the `URL` field.
Go to the next step, copy in the desired `Vendor ID` and `Vendor Token`to their respective fields in the connector setup and submit.

Your Farmers AGP Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

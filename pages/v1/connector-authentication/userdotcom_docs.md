## Authentication

To authenticate the User<span></span>.com connector you will need your application's subdomain and API Key.

### Obtaining Your Authentication Credentials

1. [Login](https://app.user.com/accounts/login/) or [create an account](https://app.user.com/accounts/register/)

2. Select an existing application or create a new one. You must provide a subddomain for your application upon it's creation

3. From your selected application's dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Setup & integrations**

   ![user dot com interface](./images/userdotcom_3.png)

4. You will be redirected to a page where your application's key and subdomain are presented. (Note: This API Key is **not to be confused with the API Key used for authentication**, the API Key used for authentication will be a 64 character length string)

5. Using the credentials obtained in step 4, you can now access your Public REST API Key (used for authentication) at the following location:

   https://**Subdomain**.user.com/api/**ApplicationKey**/credentials/

   > So with the example credentials above our URL would be: `https://example.user.com/api/ABC123/credentials/`

6. Your Public REST API key should be present, if not you can generate a new one

### Connector Setup

1. Locate the User<span></span>.com connector

   > Cyclr Console > Connectors > Connector Library > User<span></span>.com

2. From the Edit Connector interface click 'Setup'

3. Enter your Subdomain, click 'Next'

4. Enter your API Key (64 character Public REST API key), click 'Next'

The connector is now authenticated and ready to use.

## Webhooks

You have the ability to configure webhooks, triggered upon the completion of specified events.

In this example we will configure a webhook that is triggered upon the creation of a new user. We will then retrieve that user's details.

1. From your selected application's dashboard, go to **Automations**

12. We need to create a test user which will be sent to the webhook, providing it with a user object to extract the fields from

13. From the User<span></span>.com dashboard navigate to **Data > People**

    ![user dot com interface](./images/userdotcom_19.png)

14. Click 'Create user', enter some dummy data and click 'Save'

16. You can now map the required **User ID** within **Get User By ID**'s step setup.

17. Now that the workflow has been configured click 'Run' in the top-left corner of the workflow buider

The workflow is now active. Each time a user is created, the webhook will be triggered and the new user's details will be retrieved.

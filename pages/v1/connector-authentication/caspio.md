## Cyclr Setup

Setup your Caspio within Cyclr:

- Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
- Choose Connector Library
- Scroll down to **Caspio**
- Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

> **Account Subdomain**

> Please see _'Setting up your account'_ for where to get these details.

Your Caspio Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

## Utilising Custom Object Categories

The methods within some categories (like Tables) require you to create a custom object category. This is to create a clearer user experience when creating cycles.

In Cyclr:

1. Go to My Connectors.
2. Select Capsio.
3. When some categories are expanded (to reveal their methods) a copy button will appear below the category name.
4. Once you press this button, you will be able to select which item to create the Custom Category for (For example a specified Table).
5. Now when you return to your Cycle editor, you will see the new category (marked with a star), which will automatically connect with the object that was assigned to it.

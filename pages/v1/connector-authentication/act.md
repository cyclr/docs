* Base URL
  * Cloud: Enter your Act address changing app to api - so if your address bar reads appeu.act.com, enter  'https://apieu.act.com/act.web.api'
  * Self-Hosted: Check your domain URL ("http://<yourip or domain>/api/system) with your system administrator. i.e. if you can reach "http://1.1.1.1/api/system" you should enter "https://1.1.1.1"

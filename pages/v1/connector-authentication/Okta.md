To set up the Okta Connector, your user will need an **API token**.

To create an API token they will need follow these steps:

1. Sign in to their Okta organization as a user with administrator privileges.
2. Access the API page: In the Admin Console, select **API** from the Security menu and then select the Tokens tab.
3. Click **Create Token**.
4. Name the token and click **Create Token**.
5. Record the token value. This is the only opportunity to see it and record it.

The token can then be used to authenticate the Okta Connector within Cyclr.

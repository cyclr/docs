## Partner Setup

To authenticate the Mailchimp connector you will need a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.  These are obtained by setting up an application within your Mailchimp account.

### Setting up an application in Mailchimp

1. Navigate to the [Registered Apps](https://us1.admin.mailchimp.com/account/oauth2/) page in your Mailchimp account.
2. Click the [Register An App](https://us19.admin.mailchimp.com/account/oauth2/client/) link.
3. Fill out the **Register An App** form.
4. When completing the form, you will be asked for a **Redirect URI**.  You should enter<br/>
    <br/>
    https://``Your Service Domain``/connector/callback<br/>
    <br/>
    > Your service domain can be found in your Cyclr console under **Settings** > **General Settings** > **Service Domain**.
5. Once you have completed the form, click **Create**, and you will be presented with a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.  You can now use these to authenticate your application.

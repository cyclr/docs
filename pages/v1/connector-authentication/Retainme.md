# Retain.me setup

To authenticate the Retain.me connector, you need multiple authentication details for the different Retain.me APIs. Dependant on the API you want to use, you need the following details:

* DC API Username and Password
* Orders API Username and Password
* SMART Returns API Username and Password

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Retain.me connector in Cyclr, go to your **Cyclr Console**.

1. Select **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library** at the top of the page.

2. Use the search box to find the **Retain.me** connector.

3. Select the **Setup** icon.

4. Enter your Username and Password for each API you want to use in the connector.

5. Select **Save Changes**.

Each API has a category of methods within the connector, and these require their corresponding username and password to be entered in the connector set-up page. Each set of credentials are optional if you are not using the corresponding API in the connector. 

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

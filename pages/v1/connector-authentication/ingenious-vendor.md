## Partner Setup

#### Setting the correct API key 
The API key is your subdomain, token and secret separated by a space (" "). For example, if your subdomain was "sub", your token was "abc123" and your secret was "secret123", you would set the API key to be "sub abc123 secret123".

### Cyclr Setup

Setup your Ingenious Vendor App within Cyclr:

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **Ingenious Vendor**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Domain**: Your API domain. For example, if your API domain is https://api.ingenious.com/api.. you would set this as "api.ingenhous.com".

**API Key**: See the previous step in this documentation to learn how to set this value.


Your Ingenious Vendor Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

# CallRail setup

To authenticate the CallRail connector, you will need the following pieces of information:

* `API Key`

* `Account ID`

To obtain your `Account ID` and authenticate the connector, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Log into the CallRail web UI
Log into the CallRail web frontend found [here](https://app.callrail.com/) using your CallRail credentials. 
### 2. Find your `Account ID`
When viewing the CallRail dashboard from the previous step, you will find your nine digit `Account ID` following `/a/`  in the URL displayed in the browser.
### 3. Authenticate your connector
You can now authenticate your CallRail connector. To do this, first enter your `Account ID`and click next. Then enter your `API Key` and click next again.

Your CallRail Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

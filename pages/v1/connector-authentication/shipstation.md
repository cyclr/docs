> If you've already generated your API keys, the existing API keys will be displayed here and the button will say Regenerate API Keys.

## Setting up the ShipStation Connector

You can now use the Key and Secret retrieved on the previous step, to authenticate the connector.  Enter the Key in the ``Username`` field, and the Secret in the ``Password`` field.

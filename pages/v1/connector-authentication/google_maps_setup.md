### Creating API keys

The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

To create an API key:

1. Go to the **Google Maps Platform** > **Credentials** page [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/google/maps-apis/credentials)

2. On the **Credentials** page, click **Create credentials** > **API key**. The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key

3. Click Close. The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys

### Connector Setup

1. Locate the Google Maps connector

   > Cyclr Console > Connectors > Application Connector Library > Google Maps

2. Click the open padlock

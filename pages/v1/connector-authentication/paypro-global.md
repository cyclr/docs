# PayPro Global

## Setup

In order to install a PayPro Global Connector, you will need an API secret key, and your Vendor ID.

Your API secret key will have been provided to you separately by PayPro.

Your Vendor ID can be found by going to https://cc.payproglobal.com/AccountSettings/BusinessInfo.  

It will be listed as your "PayPro account ID". 

You can then use the API secret key and Vendor ID to authenticate the connector.

ORBIT is LAUNCH’s companion, giving your users a screen where they can view their installed integrations as well as pause and delete them.

As a prepackaged integration management solution, ORBIT is deployed in a similar fashion to LAUNCH, being made accessible to your users via a pop-up, modal or iframe.

ORBIT’s styling and layout can also be customised from within the Cyclr Console. You can set your own custom HTML and CSS in **Settings > Appearance Settings**

### Deploying ORBIT

You should use a non-account restricted OAuth token as the Authorization for this request.

Request to Cyclr API:

```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"
-d '{}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/accounts/{AccountId}/orbit"
```

### ORBIT Response

JSON response from API, using the OrbitUrl will signin the user to the account and goto orbit view.

Note: URL is only valid for 5 minutes.

```json
{
    "AccountId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "ExpiresAtUtc": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
    "OrbitUrl": "https://hostapp.cyclr.com/account/signinwithtoken?token=abc123&returnUrl=%2Forbit",
    "Token": "abc123"
}
```

> After deploying ORBIT you will see an API User in your Cyclr console.
> The API User has access to the account however they cannot sign in to the Cyclr interface.

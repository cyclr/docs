If you are setting up a Connector that requires an IP to be allowed, you can find the addresses that Cyclr *sends* API requests from below.

If your Cyclr Partner Console is hosted on one of our shared stacks, you should use the appropriate IP addresses from this list:

| Server Location | URL | IP Address |
| --- | --- | --- 
| US (North Virginia) | my.cyclr.com | 52.22.119.215 |
| UK (London) | my.cyclr.uk | 52.56.244.97 |
| EU (Frankfurt) | eu.cyclr.com | 18.185.231.228 |
| APAC (Syndney) | apac.cyclr.com | 54.66.28.210 |

If your Cyclr Partner Console is in a private cloud then please contact Cyclr Support.

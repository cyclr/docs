## Build the Marketplace

To start to build a Marketplace, select the **Add Card** tile. This opens a pop-up with the following options:

* [**Rich Text**](#rich-text)
* [**Category**](#category)
* [**Integration Package**](#integration-package)
* [**Action Link**](#action-link)

After you add the first card, to add another, select the **Add New** button in the top right of the window. Once you add cards, you can drag and drop each card to arrange them according to your needs.

## Rich Text

You can use Rich Text to add headings, subheadings and any other text you need to the Marketplace.

You can enter the text directly into the box, and use the toolbar to customize the appearance of this text.

Any text that you add displays in a card that stretches the full width of the screen.

## Category

The category card creates a folder that can store cards within it. You can use these categories to differentiate and manage different elements within your Marketplace.

For example, you could group all cards relating to a specific application in a category, instead of displaying them all on the first page.

Enter a name to display on the card and select **Add** to add it to the Marketplace.


### Edit Category

To edit the appearance of the category card, hover over the card and select the **Edit** button that appears. You can then select each element on the card to edit them.

To identify the category for your users, add a title and a description. You also have the option to upload and add two images at the top of the card. For example, you could add the logos of the applications within the category.

Select the tag icon in the bottom right of the card in order to add a tag. This allows your customer to filter the available cards in your Marketplace and find what’s relevant to them.


### Add cards inside a category

You can add cards inside a category:

1.  Hover over the category card and select the **Edit **button that appears.
2. Select the **Edit Category** button.
3. Add cards in the same way as on the main Marketplace page.

To navigate back to the main Marketplace page, use the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the window.

**Note**: The settings that you set within a category only apply to that category and not the Marketplace as a whole.

## Integration Package

An integration package contains a selection of related cycle templates for your customers to install.

You can set up the integration package within the popup window:

1. Give the integration package an identifiable name for your customers.
2. Select the templates that you want to include in the package from the dropdown.
3. Enter an **Installed Message** that the Marketplace displays when your customer finishes installing the package.

### Integration Package settings

There are three toggles available for an integration package:

| **Toggle** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Single Installation** | Select this toggle to limit the package to a single installation per customer. If you turn on **Single Installation**, your customers can’t be able to install the package if they already have any of the included templates installed. |
| **Redirect Back to Marketplace on Install Complete** | Select this toggle to redirect your customers back to the Marketplace once they install the package. Otherwise, the Marketplace displays the [LAUNCH Complete HTML](marketplace-callback). |
| **Auto Start on Install Complete** | Select this toggle to open and run the integration immediately when your customer installs the integration package. |

### Edit Integration Package

To edit the appearance of the Integration Package card, hover over the card and select the **Edit** button that appears. You can then select each element on the card to edit them.

To identify the Integration Package for your users, add a title and a description. You also have the option to upload and add two images at the top of the card. For example, you could add the logos of the applications connectors used in the Integration Package.

Select the tag icon in the bottom right of the card in order to add a tag. This allows your customer to filter the available cards in your Marketplace and find what’s relevant to them.

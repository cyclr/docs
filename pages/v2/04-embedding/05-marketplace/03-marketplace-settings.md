To set up your Marketplace, select the **Settings** icon on the Marketplace window. From the **Marketplace Settings** page, you can edit the name and description of your Marketplace, as well as the number of columns your integrations are displayed in.

The subsequent fields are filled with default values for the terms that are displayed on the Marketplace. You can change any of these terms to customize the appearance of your Marketplace.

The last field is the **Marketplace Notification URL**. This is the URL that Cyclr will send a message to in order to update you on the usage of your Marketplace.

Underneath the fields, there are a series of toggle settings that you can turn on or off.

| **Toggle setting** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Integration Package Details View** | Enables you to view installed cycles for a Marketplace package so you can see how your customers use your Marketplace. |
| **Installing Package View Enabled** | Displays a spinner when your user installs a package. |
| **Integration Package Configuration View** | Allows you to see the variables your user enters when they install a package. |
| **Wizard Mappings View Enabled** | Displays field mappings in a wizard instead of a single page when the user installs a package. |
| **Data Type Mismatch Warnings Enabled** | Indicates if the data type warning should be shown during mapping when a user installs Marketplace. |

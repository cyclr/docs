LAUNCH is a predefined integration installation flow that you can present as a popup to your users through a button within your application.

This means that you can present your connectors to your users with reduced burden on your interface developers. 

For a visual summary of how to set up LAUNCH, you can go to **Embedding** > **LAUNCH** in your Cyclr console.

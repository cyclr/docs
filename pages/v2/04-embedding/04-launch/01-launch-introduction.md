Cyclr LAUNCH enables SaaS businesses to make use of Cyclr’s extensive connectivity platform with a reduced burden on their user interface developers.

A predefined integration installation flow, similar to a standard OAuth flow, is presented as a popup to your users when they click a “Connect” (or similar) button within your application.

To see a visual summary of how to set up LAUNCH, go to **Embedding**> **LAUNCH** in your Cyclr console.

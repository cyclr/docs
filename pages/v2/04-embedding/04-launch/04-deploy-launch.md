## Overview

When integrating with LAUNCH you can decide whether all users access it using the same built-in Account-level "API User" (**Account LAUNCH** - this is the typical approach), or create separate users for each in the Cyclr Account (**User LAUNCH**).


To enable your users to add an integration, present a "Connect" button or link within your application's interface.

</section>
<section class="card">
## Account LAUNCH

When a user clicks the **Connect** button, your application server should make a Request towards the Cyclr REST API's `/v1.0/accounts/CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID/launch` endpoint to obtain a **LAUNCH URL**.  The user can then be directed to this URL in their web browser.

### Request
```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "AccountName": "CYCLR_ACCOUNT_NAME",
    "ConnectorAuthentications": {
        "Name": "Example Connector",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "AuthValue": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "http://customDomain.appName.com"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/accounts/CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID/launch"
```

In the example above, replace *yourCyclrInstance* with your [**API Domain** according to where your Cyclr Console is located](./testing-cyclr-api), or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

When [obtaining a Cyclr API Access Token](./cyclr-api-authentication) for this call, you should *not* use an Account Restricted Token.

## User LAUNCH

When a user clicks the **Connect** button, your application server should make a request towards the Cyclr REST API's _/v1.0/users/launch_ endpoint:

> A new user will be created if the don't already exist.

### Request
```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{

        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "https://myapp.something.blah"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/users/launch"
```

Replace *yourCyclrInstance* with *api.cyclr.com*, *api.cyclr.uk*, or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

You should use a non-account restricted OAuth token as the Authorization for this request.

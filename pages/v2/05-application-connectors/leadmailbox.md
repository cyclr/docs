When the Post Leads method is called additionally you will need to provide the name of the Campaign to which the lead should be added.  You can check these values by:

From the LeadMailbox dashboard, click 
1. ``Settings``
2. ``Campaigns``

This shows the values to be used for both the Account Name and the Campaign Name.

## Additional information

### Using Webhooks

Webhook requests undergo a validation check before being accepted. Make sure you have provided a secret for the webhook in Disciple Media (https://<span>{AccountSubdomain}.</span>disciplemedia.com/admin/webhooks/) and entered that secret at connector setup. If no secret is provided or the secret does not match the webhook will be rejected.

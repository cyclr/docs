## Connector Setup

When the connector is setup on an account you will need to provide:
* **Freshdesk Domain**: The name of your Freshdesk domain, e.g. "myaccount.freshdesk.com" without "https://" or a trailing forward slash.  Must be a freshdesk.com domain; custom domains are not allowed.

### Webhooks

3. Choose **Rules that run on: Ticket Updates**.
4. Click **New rule**.
5. Set **Rule name** and **Involves any of these events** as follows:

    ![Rule settings](./images/rule_settings.png)
6. You can leave **On tickets with these properties** as it is.
9. Under Perform these actions, set **Choose Action** to **Trigger Webhook**.
10. Set Request Type to **POST**.
11. For the **URL**, you will need to go back to your Cyclr workflow, and copy the address from the webhook step.  You can find it by clicking the step's settings cog.
12. Leave the other fields as they are, and under Content, select **Advanced**.
13. The section should now look like this:

    ![Rule settings 2](./images/rule_settings2.png)
13. In the **Write custom API request** text box, paste the following template:

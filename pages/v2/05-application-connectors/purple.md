### Cyclr Setup

Setup your Purple App within Cyclr:

*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **Purple**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Domain**: The Purple domain you use to login with. For example, if the URL of the website you use to login to is "https://portal.company.com/login" you would enter "portal.company.com" here.

**Public Key**: Retrieved from Purple support.

Your Purple Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

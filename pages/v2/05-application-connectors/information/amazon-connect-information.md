## Add custom fields

Your records may contain custom fields that aren't mapped for each method's request or response fields. For example, the [Get Task Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetTaskTemplate.html) method returns a list of custom tags.

To add mappings for a custom field, you can follow the steps in the Cyclr documentation on how to [add custom fields](adding-custom-fields#manually-add-custom-fields).

To add a custom field, you also need to provide the API field name for the **Field Location** of the custom field.

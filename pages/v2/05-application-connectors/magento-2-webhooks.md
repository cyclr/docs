Magento 2 Webhooks Setup
---------------

---
It is assumed that you have already installed our [Magento 2 Webhooks plugin](https://github.com/cyclr/cyclr-magento-2).

---

To authenticate the connector you will need to use your existing Magento 2 API Key.

If you have not yet set up an integration within Magento for Cyclr to use (for the main Magento connector) - there are instructions on how to do so here: https://docs.cyclr.com/magento-2-connector#magento-2-setup

To find your API key when this is done, 

1. Log in to the admin portal, and click `System` > `Extensions` > `Integrations`.
2. Click the `Edit` pencil next to your integration.

3. Scroll down and copy your access token

Now that you have your Access token go to the `Connector Setup` page in Cyclr.

1. On the first page you should enter the URL of your Magento site e.g. `https://my-magento-site.com` and click `Next`.
2. Paste your `Access Token` into the `API Key` field and click `Next`.  (Be sure to enter your **Access Token** and not your **Consumer Key**).
3. Your connector is now setup and ready to go!

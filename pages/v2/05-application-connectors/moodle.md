## Partner Setup

To authenticate the Moodle connector you will need an `API Token`. This is obtained by setting up an application within your Moodle environment.

### Setting up an application in Moodle

Navigate to `Site Administration > Plugins > Web Services`

Start following the guide for "Allow an external system to control Moodle" (Pictured below).

The only protocol you will need to enable in *Step 2* is `REST`.

After creating your specific user in *Step 3*, you will need to create and assign a role to this user. Follow these steps to do this.

Navigate to `Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Define Roles`

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click "Add a new role". The Manager archetype is recommended. 

After the first step you will reach a page that allows customisation of this role; the part we are interested in sits at the bottom of the page (Pictured below).

You must enable all the capabilities listed in the table below. Copying and pasting is recommended to save time. Once this is done click "Create this role".

| User Capability    |
| ------------------ |
| moodle/course:view |
| moodle/course:update |
| moodle/course:viewhiddencourses |
| moodle/course:managegroups |
| moodle/user:create |
| moodle/user:viewdetails |
| moodle/user:viewhiddendetails |
| moodle/course:useremail |
| moodle/user:update |
| enrol/manual:enrol |
| moodle/grade:view |

You now need to assign this role to the user. To do this you need to navigate to `Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Assign system roles`

Click the role you have just created, and then on the next page assign the user.

For *Step 6* you will need to enable the following functions to be able to use all Cyclr methods:

| Service Functions               |
| ------------------------------- |
| core_group_add_group_members    |
| core_group_assign_grouping      |
| core_group_create_groupings     |
| core_group_create_groups        |
| core_group_delete_group_members |
| core_group_delete_groupings     |
| core_group_delete_groups |
| core_group_get_activity_allowed_groups |
| core_group_get_activity_groupmode |
| core_group_get_course_groupings |
| core_group_get_course_groups |
| core_group_get_course_user_groups |
| core_group_get_group_members |
| core_group_get_groupings |
| core_group_get_groups |
| core_group_unassign_grouping |
| core_group_update_groupings |
| core_group_update_groups |
| enrol_manual_enrol_users |
| enrol_manual_unenrol_users |
| core_course_get_courses |
| core_user_create_users |
| core_user_get_users |
| gradereport_overview_get_course_grades |
| core_auth_request_password_reset |

Once the Moodle Web Service application has been created, you need to create a token, selecting the user with the above permissions, and the newly created service (Pictured below).

Copy this token, and use it to authenticate in Cyclr.

Five9 recommend using the credentials of a user with the Virtual Call Center supervisor role. This user needs to have the relevant permissions enabled to allow them to send requests to the Five9 API. You can find more information about permissions in the **Users** chapter of the Five9 Virtual Contact Center Basic Administratorâ€™s Guide.

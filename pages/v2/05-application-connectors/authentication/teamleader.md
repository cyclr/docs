## Teamleader setup

To connect with Cyclr, you need the following authentication values from your Teamleader account:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Username
- Password

If you don't have a Teamleader account, you can sign up for one on the [Teamleader](https://signup.focus.teamleader.eu/) page.

To find the Client ID and Client Secret of your account, go to the [Teamleader marketplace management](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/eu/en/manage) page.




For more information, see the Teamleader documentation on [authentication](https://developer.teamleader.eu/#/introduction/authentication).

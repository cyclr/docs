## QuickBooks setup

To authenticate the Quickbooks connector, you need a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

To obtain these values, you need a QuickBooks Online application. You can create an app through the Quickbooks [developer portal]((https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/myapps):

> **Note**: There are sections for **Development** and **Production** apps, and these steps are for a **Development** app.

1. Select the **Create an app** button and select **QuickBooks Online and Payments**.
2. Name your app and select **Accounting** from the scopes.  If you're based in the US, you can add the **Payments** scope later.
3. Select **Create App**.
4. Go to **Development** > **Keys & OAuth**, and note down the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
5. Under **Redirect URIs**, change the existing value to: `https://{ServiceDomain}/connector/callback`.

    > **Note**: To find your Service domain in your Cyclr Console, go to **Settings** > **General Settings** > **Service Domain**.

6. Scroll down and select **Save**.

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Quickbooks connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Quickbooks connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | Value              | Description                                 |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
   | **Client ID**   | The **Client ID** from your Quickbook application. |
   | **Client Secret**   | The **Client Secret** from your Quickbook application.                               |
   | **Callback URL**| Cyclr fills this field by default.           |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

### Account setup

Cyclr also asks you for the **Base Domain** when you install the Quickbooks connector into an account

* For a development app, use `sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com`.
* For a production app, use `quickbooks.api.intuit.com`.

### Realm ID

If your customer sets a **Realm ID** (Company ID) at the point of Connector installation, this will be used across all cycles using this Connector.  Otherwise each step will ask for this value.  

Your customer can find their **Realm ID** in Quickbooks by:

1. Going to Settings âš™ and select **Your Account** and settings
2. On the **Your Account** page their Realm ID/Company ID (in the billing & subscription tab) will be at the top.

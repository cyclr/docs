## Cyclr setup

To set up the <connector name> connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the FindEmails connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | **Value**          | **Description**                                   |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
   | **API Key**        | The API key created when setting up the account.  |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

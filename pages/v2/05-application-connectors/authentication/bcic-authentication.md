## BCIC setup

To authenticate your connector, you need the username and password for the account you want to connect with Cyclr. 

You also need the **Host Name** of the instance that you want to access. You can find the **Host Name** in the URL of the account. For example, if you want to access `https://app.cyclraccess.com/prod5/api2/data`, then your **Host Name** is `app.cyclraccess.com`.

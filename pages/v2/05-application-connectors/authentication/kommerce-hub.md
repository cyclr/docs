## Kommerce Hub setup

### Get authentication details

To authenticate your connector, you need to get the authentication details. 

Kommerce Hub will need to provide you with a username and password.
  
You will also need the domain specific to your account from Kommerce Hub.

These can all be provided with direct written contact with them.

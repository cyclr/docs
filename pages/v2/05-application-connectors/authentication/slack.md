## Partner Setup

Slack uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication so you need to [register your Cyclr Partner with Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps) to obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values.

From [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), select the **Create an App** button, select **From scratch** then enter the:
*  **App Name** - a name for your App.  This will be shown on-screen when users install the Slack Connector, and also appear as the username when you post to Slack.
*  **Development Slack Workspace** - which Slack Workspace your App belongs to.  This just gives it a "home" and doesn't prevent it from being installed in other people's workspaces.

After you've created your App, set the **Redirect URLs** under the **Add features and functionality** section's **Permissions** button:

![Slack - Permissions](./images/slack-permissions.png)

**Redirect URL**: you must add a callback URL to allow Intercom to be used in your Cyclr Console and its accounts.

The URL is:

*   {% raw %}https://{{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback{% endraw %}

You can find your Cyclr Partner **Service Domain** in your Cyclr console under **Settings** > **General Settings**.

Once added, the redirect URL's look similar to the ones shown below:

### Request Scopes
Scroll down to the Scopes section and click to **Add an OAuth Scope**. Scopes can be modified at a later stage by navigating to the **OAuth & Permissions** sidebar.

For example, if you add the `chat:write` scope to your Bot Token, it allows your app to post messages. If you add the `channels:read`, your app can access data about public Slack channels.

>  **Note**: Add scopes to your Bot Token, not your User Token. You only need a User Token if you need to act as a specific user (for example, posting messages on behalf of a user, or setting a user's status).

### Get authentication details

To retrieve your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values, go to **Basic Information** on the left then scrolling down to **App Credentials**.

### Distribution (Optional)
If you want workspaces other than your own to use the app, slack now requires you to activate public distribution:

1.  Navigate to your **Basic Information** page, select the dropdown for **Manage Distribution** and select **Distribute App**. 

  ![Slack - Manage Distribution](./images/slack-manage-distribution.png)

2.  This screen shows any redirect URLs and features you have setup. 

3.  Follow the steps in **Remove Hard Coded Information** and make sure you select **Use HTTPS For Your Features**.

4.  Select **Activate Public Distribution** to make the app available to others, outside of your workspace.

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Slack connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Slack connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

| Value              | Description                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Client ID**   | The client ID of the Slack account.                               |
| **Client Secret**   | The client secret of the Slack account.                             |
| **Scope**| **Optional**: You can specify scopes instead of using the default ones.       |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Duel connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Duel connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | **Value**          | **Description**                             |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
   | **Username**   | The username you use to log into your Duel instance.                    |
   | **Password**   | The password you use to log into your Duel instance.                     |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

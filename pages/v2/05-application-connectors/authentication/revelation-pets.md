## Cyclr setup

To set up the Revelation Pets connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Revelation Pets connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | Value              | Description                                 |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
   | **API Key**   | Retrieved from the **Partner Setup** steps above. |
   | **Base URL**  | Select either the EU or US endpoint depending on where your Revelation Pets instance is based. |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

## Gist setup

### Get authentication details

To authenticate your connector, you need to get the authentication details. 

Go to the [Gist Website Settings](https://app.getgist.com/projects/hipgyaas/settings/api-key) page and make note of the API Key.

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Gist connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Gist connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | **Value**          | **Description**                             |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
   | **API Key**        | The API key you recorded.                   |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

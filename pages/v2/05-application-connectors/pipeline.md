## Pipeline setup

To set up the Pipeline connector, you need the following authentication values from your [Pipeline](https://app.pipelinecrm.com/api/docs#section/Introduction) account:

*  App Key: a unique application key that tells Pipeline what integration is making the API request.
*  API Key: a unique user key that authenticates the user.

## Cyclr setup

To set up the Pipeline connector in Cyclr, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Go to **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library**.

2. Use the search box to find the Pipeline connector.

3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.

4. Enter the below values:

   | Value              | Description                                 |
   | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
   | **APP KEY**        | The Pipeline APP KEY.                       |
   | **API KEY**        | The Pipeline API KEY                        |

5. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: If you leave any values blank, Cyclr asks for the value when you install the connector into an account. This means you can use different settings for different accounts.

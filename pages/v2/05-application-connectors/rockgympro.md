## Authentication

Rock Gym Pro uses Basic authentication. 

To make requests you will need your API username and password.  These are not the same credentials you use to log into the Rock Gym Pro portal.

### Finding your API username and password

Visit https://app.rgprocloud.net/admin/api_keys and copy down the Username, and API Key.

You can then use these as Username and Password when authenticating the connector.

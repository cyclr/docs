## Cyclr Setup

Setup your Tenstreet App within Cyclr:

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **Tenstreet**
*   Click the **Setup** button

### Partner Setup

In order to get the webhook service working, you'll need to contact Tenstreet customer support and ask them to set up sending data to the webhook. When dragging the webhook into the builder, it will automatically generate a URL in the set up for the step. You'll need to send this URL to Tenstreet so that they can fire off your data to our service.

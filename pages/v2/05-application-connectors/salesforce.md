## Partner Setup

Salesforce uses OAuth 2 for remote API access. You must register Cyclr within Salesforce as your own Connected App to receive OAuth Client ID and Client Secret values to enable Cyclr to authenticate with Salesforce.

The official Salesforce documentation for creating a **Connected App** can be found [here](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm).

## Salesforce Setup – Register Your Application

### Introduction

You can register for a free [Salesforce Developer Edition account here (click "Sign Up" at the top of that page)](https://developer.salesforce.com/) or log into your existing Salesforce account if you have one.  You can use any Salesforce account to create a Connected App, it doesn’t have to be a Developer Edition account, but we would advise against using a Sandbox account as Connected Apps are destroyed when they are refreshed.

### Create your App within Salesforce

The process of creating an app in Salesforce varies slightly depending upon whether you are using **Salesforce Classic**, or **Lightning Experience**.

> #### Salesforce Classic 
> 1.   Log into your Salesforce account
> 2.   Click **Setup** in the top right
> 3.   From the menu on the left, select **Build** > **Create** > **Apps**
> 4.   From the **Connected Apps** table click **New**

> #### Lightning Experience
> 1.   Log into your Salesforce account
> 2.   click **Setup** in the top right
> 3.   From the menu on the left, select **Platform Tools** > **Apps** > **App Manager**
> 4.   Click **New Connected App**

#### Basic Information

Whether you are using **Salesforce Classic** or **Lightning Experience**, when the **New Connected App** screen is shown, complete the form as follows:

**Connected App Name:** enter a name for your application

**API Name:** this will default to the same value as your Connected App Name

**Contact Email:** your email address

#### API (Enable OAuth Settings)

Tick the **Enable OAuth Settings** box to display further options.

**Callback URL**: you must add a callback URL to allow Salesforce to be used in your Cyclr Console and its accounts.

The URLs is:

*   {% raw %}https://{{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback{% endraw %}

**Selected OAuth Scopes**: you must add the following 2 Scopes to enable Cyclr to use your App:

*   Full access (full) or if you know which data you wish to restrict to you can select from this [list](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm&type=5)
*   Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh\_token, offline\_access)

The OAuth settings should look like this:

![Salesforce OAuth Partner Setup](./images/salesforce-partner-setup-oauth.png)

After saving your App, make a note of your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values as you’ll need to enter these into Cyclr.

***IMPORTANT** It can take up to 10 minutes for any changes to your Connected App to take effect in Salesforce.*

![Salesforce Update Error](./images/salesforce_update_error.png)

*If you attempt to use your app before it has had time to update, you may encounter this error.*



### Cyclr Setup

Setup your Salesforce App within Cyclr:

*   go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   choose Connector Library
*   scroll down to **Salesforce**
*   click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Client ID**:  the _Consumer Key_ of your Salesforce Connected App

**Client Secret**: the _Consumer Secret_ of your Salesforce Connected App

Your Salesforce Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

## Webhook Setup
### Add Webhook class to SalesForce account
* Login into your Salesforce Account, navigate to the top right corner and click the **Clog** icon, then click **Setup**.
* Navigate to the left panel, scroll down and click **Custom Code**, then click **Apex Classes**
* Create a new **Apex Class** by clicking **New**
* Name it **Webhook** and paste the following code snippet:

```javascript
  public class Webhook implements HttpCalloutMock {

    public static HttpRequest request;
    public static HttpResponse response;

    public HTTPResponse respond(HTTPRequest req) {
        request = req;
        response = new HttpResponse();
        response.setStatusCode(200);
        return response;
    }

    public static String jsonContent(List<Object> triggerNew, List<Object> triggerOld) {
        String newObjects = '[]';
        if (triggerNew != null) {
            newObjects = JSON.serialize(triggerNew);
        }

        String oldObjects = '[]';
        if (triggerOld != null) {
            oldObjects = JSON.serialize(triggerOld);
        }

        String userId = JSON.serialize(UserInfo.getUserId());

        String content = '{"new": ' + newObjects + ', "old": ' + oldObjects + ', "userId": ' + userId + '}';
        return content;
    }

    @future(callout=true)
    public static void callout(String url, String content) {

        if (Test.isRunningTest()) {
            Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new Webhook());
        }

        Http h = new Http();

        HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
        req.setEndpoint(url);
        req.setMethod('POST');
        req.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        req.setBody(content);

        h.send(req);
    }

}
```
###  Add Service Domain
* Go to your Cyclr console, click **Setings** and **General Settings**
* Copy your **Service Domain**  
* Login into your Salesforce Account, navigate to the top right corner and click the **Clog** icon, then click **Setup**.
* Navigate to the left panel, scroll down and click **Security**, then click **Remote Site Settings**
* Click **New Remote Site** and give it a name and add your **Service Domain** from the second step.

Now your account is set and ready to use webhooks in your account.

## Enduser Salesforce Account Setup

For the best experience when using the Salesforce Connector, and to reduce the frequency at which Cyclr must obtain a new Access Token and avoid some connection issues, ensure the following Session Settings have been set:

Log in to the Salesforce organization, go to Setup, then use the Search to find "Session Settings".

Under **Session Timeout**
*  Timeout Value: set this for as long as possible, e.g. 24 hours.
*  Force logout on session timeout: disable this.

Under **Session Settings**
*  Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated: disable this.

## FAQ

### Expired access/refresh token errors

Salesforce only allows up to five unique access/refresh token pairs to be issued for each user in a Connected App. Older tokens will be automatically revoked by Salesforce.  [More information](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_request_manage.htm).

### Disabling Assignment Rules

When creating Accounts, Cases, or Leads in Salesforce, it may be desirable to prevent Salesforce's "active assignment rules" from being applied.  This very much depends on what assignment rules have been setup within Salesforce so will depend on the enduser's requirements.

To prevent assignment rules from being applied, add this Script to a Salesforce step in the Cycle Builder:

```javascript
function before_action() {
    // Don't apply Salesforce's assignment rules.
    method_request_headers['Sforce-Auto-Assign'] = 'FALSE';

    return true;
}
```
[More information](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/headers_autoassign.htm)

### Working with CSV documents

To retrieve the contents of a CSV document, you will need to take the following steps:

1. Find the Document ID.  This can be found in the response you recieved when you made the file, or by running "List Content Documents".
2. Use this ID in a "Get Content Version" call to get the Content Version ID.
3. Enter the Content Version ID in a "Get Content Document Data (CSV)" call.
4. You will need to add the fields within connector settings so that you can map them.  The field location will be '[].yourcolumname' without quotes.

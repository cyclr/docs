## Support team

> **Note**: If you can't access the **Help** button or the [Support Portal](https://support.cyclr.com), you can email `help@cyclr.com` instead.

### Through the console

To contact our support team, you can select the **Help** button in the bottom right corner of your Cyclr console. You can then fill out the form with your details and a description of what you need. You can also attach up to 5 files if you think they'll be helpful.


### Through the Support Portal

 You can also go to [`https://support.cyclr.com/`](https://support.cyclr.com) to **Submit a Request**. From the portal, you can enter a subject, description, and select a priority level for your issue, as well as add any relevant attachments.

#### View tickets

When you raise an issue with the Cyclr Support team, you can view that ticket, and any others you may have, through the [Cyclr Zendesk portal](https://support.cyclr.com). The portal provides a centralized location to view your support requests instead of using emails. From the portal, you can view all of the current and closed tickets that belong to your organization. This allows you to access tickets related to your organization even if the requestor isn't available.

The portal displays both who requested each ticket and who is assigned to resolve the issue. You can also see the status, creation date and when the ticket was last updated.


> **Note**: If you haven’t raised a support ticket, then your email address won’t be registered to access the portal.

To view your support tickets, you need to activate your access to Cyclr’s Zendesk portal:
1. Go to [`http://support.cyclr.com/`](https://support.cyclr.com).
2. Select the **Check your Existing Requests** button.
3. At the bottom of the window, next to the text **Have you emailed us?**, select **Get a password**.

4. In the next window, enter the email you used for the support request into the **Email** field and select **Submit**.
5. Go to the email you receive from Zendesk and follow the instructions to proceed.

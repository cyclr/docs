Once you connect your application to the Cyclr API, you can use the hundreds of available application connectors and tools available through Cyclr to build fully integrated automation workflows in minutes - these workflows are cycles. You can embed these cycles in your application without Cyclr branding.

### Accounts
In your Cyclr console, you can create as many user [accounts](user-accounts) as you need; typically, each account has a one to one relationship with an account in your application. 

### Connectors
Cyclr provides hundreds of [connectors](connector-introduction) for specific applications, as well as utility connectors and tools.

### Cycle templates
The Cyclr builder allows you to use these connectors to create low code integrations with drag and drop elements. You can create these integrations as [template cycles](cycle-templates), or as a cycle directly in an account. 

### Embed Cyclr
There are four [deployment options](embed-cycles) you can use to deliver these cycles to your users in your application: use the API, use service led deployment, use Marketplace, or use the LAUNCH workflow.

### Cyclr API
If you donâ€™t want to work with cycles, you can also use [Data on Demand](data-on-demand) to perform requests and provide solutions directly to your users.

Application connectors in Cyclr are the normalized links that give you access to a third-party application.

To increase the amount of control you have over how your cycle processes data, you can combine application connectors with utility connectors.

If you need a connector that isnâ€™t in either of the connector libraries, you can either request or build a custom connector. See the [Create a custom connector](custom-connectors) section for more information.

>  **Note**: Cyclr doesn't support or maintain connectors that aren't in our application library.

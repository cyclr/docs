## Support team

You can contact the Cyclr support team through either a button in the console, or through the Cyclr [Support Portal](https://support.cyclr.com). If you can't access either of those options, you can email `help@cyclr.com` instead.

### Help button in the console

To contact our support team, you can select the **Help** button in the bottom right corner of your Cyclr console. You can then fill out the form with your details and a description of what you need. You also have the option attach up to 5 files relating to your issue.

### Cyclr Support Portal

 You can also go to [`https://support.cyclr.com/`](https://support.cyclr.com) to **Submit a Request** or **Check your Existing Requests**.

#### Submit a Request

Having clicked to **Submit a Request**, you can enter a subject, description, and select a priority level for your issue, as well as add any relevant attachments.

#### Check your Existing Requests

If you or anyone at your organisation has raised an issue with the Cyclr Support Team, you'll be able to see these, and update or even close them if you wish.  

You will also be able to see your organisation's historical closed tickets here - this allows you to access tickets related to your organization even if the requestor isn't available.

The portal displays both who requested each ticket and who is assigned to resolve the issue. You can also see the status, creation date and when the ticket was last updated.

If you haven't accessed your tickets in this way before, you'll first be asked to register and sign in.

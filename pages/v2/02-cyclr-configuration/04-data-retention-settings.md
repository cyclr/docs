## Data Retention 

The data retention settings allow you to specify how long both successful transactions and transaction errors should be retained.
 
By default, data retention for accounts is set to 31 days.
 
Retention for Successful Transactions and Errored Transactions can be turned off, and adjusted independently of each other, and the retention period can be set in Hours, Days, or Weeks.

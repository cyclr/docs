Through the **Console Administrators** page, you can invite or remove people as console administrators. A console administrator has access to both the Cyclr console and the Cyclr partner API.

The **Console Administrators** page displays a list of all your current console administrators. This list shows each administratorâ€™s username, name, and the date that they last logged in to the Cyclr console.

## Add and remove administrators

To add another user as a console administrator, select the **Invite Administrator** button in the top right corner of the page. This opens a dialogue where you can enter their email address. Cyclr then sends them an email to give them access.

To delete an administrator from your partner console, select the **Remove user from partner** bin icon.

## Account activity notifications

For each console administrator, there is the option to enable the **Account Activity Notifications** toggle. If you enable this toggle for an administrator, they receive a notification for any incidents with integration cycles or billing issues in accounts.

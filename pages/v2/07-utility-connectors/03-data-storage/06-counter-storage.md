## Purpose

 The **Counter Storage** Connector allows for multiple counters, either stored globally or within a Cyclr, to be tracked.

Counters can be created and updated in one part of the Cycle and retrieved in another.

Cycle Counters are only be accessible _within the same cycle_, where as Global Cycle Counters _persist across your account_.

The **Counter Storage** Connector works by using a Name and an Amount. The Name must be unique. The Amount will be 1 by default and can accept float values.

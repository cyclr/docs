You can use Cyclr as a proxy server to pass requests to an external application. 

If you use Cyclr as a proxy, you can send a single request and you donâ€™t have to create a cycle. This might be useful if you want to perform a simple request, or only want to perform the request once.

To send a request from an account, you need an installed and authenticated account connector. For more information, see the Authenticating a connector section of the [Connectors](installing-connectors) page.

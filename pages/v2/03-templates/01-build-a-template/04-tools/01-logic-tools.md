Cyclr provides five logic tools that you can use in your integration templates:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| [Decisions](decision-steps) | Uses conditions to filter data to follow two different paths through your integration. |
| [Delays](delay-steps) | Pauses your integration for a set time. |
| [Wait Until](wait-until-steps) | Pauses your integration until it reaches a date and time that you specify. |
| [Wait All](waot-all-steps) | Pauses your cycle until all transactions complete so that you can add closing steps to your transaction.|
| [Annotation](annotation-steps) | Allows you to annotate and make notes in your integration template. |

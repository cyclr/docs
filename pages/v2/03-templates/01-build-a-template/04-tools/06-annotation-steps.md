You can use an **Annotation** step to add text to the builder to describe the workflow. Annotations can help explain what each part of the flow does without adding long names to each step. They can also help you collaborate with your co-workers on the same templates.

You don't need to connect an annotation step to other steps, you can just place it in the builder where you want it. To add the annotation, select the **Step setup** cog icon on the step, add your text, and select **Close**.

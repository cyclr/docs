You can build integrations in Cyclr, which you can either manually install into customer accounts or provide through one of our [embedding](http://embed-cycles) options for your customers to install.

You can create these integrations as templates, which you can then use to test the integrations and install them into multiple accounts. 

> **Note**: For a specific or custom integration, you can create a cycle directly inside an account.

## Create a new template

You can build a template through the Cyclr console:

1. Select the **Design New Template** button in your Cyclr dashboard.
2. [Install and authenticate](install-and-authenticate) any connectors that you want to use.
3. [Add steps](add-steps) and use [tools](tools) to create the integration.
4. [Map the fields](field-mapping) to control how you process the data.
5. [Configure your template](template-configuration).
6. [Test the template integration](test-templates).

You can also [manage your templates](manage-templates) through the **Template Library**.

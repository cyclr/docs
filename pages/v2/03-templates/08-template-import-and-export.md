You can export templates from one Cyclr instance and import them to another. This allows you to keep templates in sync if you have Cyclr instances in multiple regions. To ensure that imported templates are identical to the exported template, the generated file includes the details of the connector releases that the template uses.

For example, if you build a template on the UK instance and want to use the exact same template on the US instance, you can use the template export import feature.

> **Note**: Cyclr doesn't currently support account connector properties and webhook key mappings for the export/import functionality.

## Export Template

You can export template releases from your Cyclr Console. To export the template as a JSON file to download, find the template in the **Template Library**, select **Releases** and then select the **Export** button.

See the screenshot below for guidance on where to find the export button in Cyclr:

## Import Templates

You can import a template release JSON file as a new template, or into an existing template as a new release (as in the screenshot above). 

To import a new template from a JSON file, go to **Templates** > **Template Library** in the console and select the **Import Template** button.

Cyclr displays an error message if there are any compatibility issues, for example, if the method can't be found on the current instance.

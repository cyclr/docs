If you create a cycle inside one of your customerâ€™s accounts, you can only access the cycle in that account. To edit and use that cycle in other accounts, you can copy the cycle to your template library.

You can copy an account cycle as a template from your console:

1. Go to **Settings** > **General Settings**.
2. Select the **Enable Cycle Sharing** toggle.
3. Go to the customer account and select the **Edit Workflow** icon of the cycle that you want to copy.
4. Select **Share**. You might need to select the connectors you want to use from the dropdown.
5. Select **Create Template**.

Once the integration is in your template library, you can use and modify the integration as normal.

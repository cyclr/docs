The **Annotation** tool allows you to annotate and make notes as part of the cycle template. For example, you can do this do describe the function of certain steps, make reminders, or explain decisions.

The **Annotation** tool doesnâ€™t connect to steps, but you can drag the tool anywhere in the template builder. Select the **Step Setup** cog icon to open the window where you can enter text.

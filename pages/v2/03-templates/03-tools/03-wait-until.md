A **Wait Until** step allows you to hold processing until the cycle reaches a specific date or time. You can use a **Wait Until** step in two ways:

* Wait for a specific date.
* Wait for a dynamic date from your data.

> **Note**: The time that you select for the **Wait Until** period needs to be within the 1 day data retention period for the integration to run to completion.

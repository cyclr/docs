1. Select **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library** at the top of the page.
2. Use the search box to find the **Mindful API** connector.
3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.
4. Enter the below values, a value here will allow you to use a different value for each installation within an account:
5. 
    | Value             | Description                                    |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | **Client ID**     | The client ID of your Mindful API account.     |
    | **Client Secret** | The client secret of your Mindful API account. |

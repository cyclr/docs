## Authenticating the connector

You can then authenticate your connector by entering your Authentication Token in the "Username" field, and a single letter X in the Password field.

Your subdomain is whatever comes before freshbooks in your freshbooks web address.  So if your address is johnsmith.freshbooks.com, the subdomain will be johnsmith

When integrating with a Cyclr Marketplace you can decide whether all users access it using the same built-in Account-level "API User" (**Account Marketplace** - this is the typical approach), or create separate users for each in the Cyclr Account (**User Marketplace**).

To enable your users to view a Marketplace and install templates, you will need to have an "Integrations" button or link within your own application's interface.

For example:

![Generic Host Application](./images/generic-host-app-connected-v2.png)

## Account Marketplace

When a user clicks the **Integrations** button, your application server should make a Request towards the Cyclr REST API's `/v1.0/accounts/CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID/marketplace` endpoint to obtain a **Marketplace URL**.  The user can then be directed to this URL in their web browser.

The **CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID** used in the URL of the call tells Cyclr which Account to work against.  If an Account doesn't already exist with that API ID, then Cyclr will create a *new* Account using that value as the API ID and the **AccountName** value provided in your Request.

### Request

```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "MarketplaceId": MARKETPLACE_ID,
    "AccountName": "CYCLR_ACCOUNT_NAME",
    "PartnerConnector": {
        "Name": "Example Connector",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "AuthValue": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "http://customDomain.appName.com"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/accounts/CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID/marketplace"
```

**All PartnerConnector Property Values must be passed as strings, even if they are numbers.**

In the example above, replace *yourCyclrInstance* with your [**API Domain** according to where your Cyclr Console is located](./testing-cyclr-api) (e.g. "api.cyclr.com"), or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

When [obtaining a Cyclr API Access Token](./cyclr-api-authentication) for this call, you should *not* use an Account Restricted Token.

## User Marketplace

When a user clicks the **Integrations** button, your application server should make a Request towards the Cyclr REST API's `/v1.0/users/marketplace` endpoint to obtain a **Marketplace URL**.  The user can then be directed to this URL in their web browser.

### Request

```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "MarketplaceId": MARKETPLACE_ID,
    "AccountName": "CYCLR_ACCOUNT_NAME",
    "AccountId": "CYCLR_ACCOUNT_API_ID",
    "Username": "USERNAME",
    "Password": "PASSWORD",
    "PartnerConnector": {
        "Name": "Example Connector",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "AuthValue": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "http://customDomain.appName.com"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/users/marketplace"
```

In the example above, replace *yourCyclrInstance* with your [**API Domain** according to where your Cyclr Console is located](./testing-cyclr-api), or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

When [obtaining a Cyclr API Access Token](./cyclr-api-authentication) for this call, you should *not* use an Account Restricted Token.

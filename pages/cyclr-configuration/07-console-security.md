## Console Administrators

Console Administrators have access to both the Cyclr Console and Cyclr Partner API.
The Console Administrators page is where you can invite or remove people as console administrators, as well as enabling or disabling Account Activity and Billing notifications on a individual basis.
 
## IP Restrictions

### API and Console
Access to the API and Console can both be edited here by white-listing approved IP addresses of your organisation. By default there is no IP restriction, however if edited only the IP addresses present will be able to access the API or Console.
 
### API - Call Non-Native Connector Methods
APIs for calling non-native (standard) connector methods are blocked by default, and can only be changed on request to the Cyclr support

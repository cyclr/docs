To enable your users to view a Marketplace, simply present a "Connect" button or link within your applicationâ€™s UI.

For example:

![Generic Host Application](./images/generic-host-app.png)

When a user clicks the **Connect** button, your application server should make a request towards the Cyclr REST API's _/v1.0/accounts/{AccountId}/marketplace_ endpoint:

### Request

```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "MarketplaceId": 123,
    "partnerConnector": {
        "Name": "Connector Name",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "AuthValue": "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "https://myapp.something.blah"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/accounts/0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/marketplace"
```
In the examples above, replace *yourCyclrInstance* with *api.cyclr.com*, *api.cyclr.uk*, or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

You should use a non-account restricted OAuth token as the Authorization for this request.

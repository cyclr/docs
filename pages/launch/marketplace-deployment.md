To enable your users to view a Marketplace, simply present a "Connect" button or link within your applicationâ€™s UI.

For example:

![Generic Host Application](./images/generic-host-app.png)

When a user clicks the **Connect** button, your application server should make a request towards the Cyclr REST API's _/v1.0/users/marketplace_ endpoint:

### Example Request to create a new Cyclr Account and obtain a Marketplace URL
This would create a new Cyclr Account, a new Cyclr User within that Account, and install a platform's Cyclr Connector into it using the **partnerConnector** object.  You can use the **partnerConnector** object to provide authentication details and other properties, to avoid your user having to set it up themselves.
```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "MarketplaceId": 27
    "Username": "user@example.com", 
    "Password": "password",
    "AccountName": "Customer X",
    "partnerConnector": {
        "Name": "Connector Name",
        "Version": "1.0",
        "AuthValue": "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "Properties": [{"Name": "Url", "Value": "https://myapp.something.blah"}]
    }
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/users/marketplace"
```

### Example Request to use an existing Cyclr Account and obtain a Marketplace URL
This tells Cyclr the existing Account to work against and the Cyclr User to impersonate.
```
curl -X POST
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Accept: application/json"

-d '{
    "MarketplaceId": 27
    "Username": "user@example.com", 
    "Password": "password",
    "AccountId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}' "https://yourCyclrInstance/v1.0/users/marketplace"
```

In the examples above, replace *yourCyclrInstance* with *api.cyclr.com*, *api.cyclr.uk*, or your own domain if your Cyclr instance is self-hosted.

You must use a [Cyclr *Partner* OAuth token](./obtain-partner-authorization-token) as the Bearer token in this Request.

# JobProgress setup

To authenticate the JobProgress connector, you will need a valid `Access Token`.

To obtain an `Access Token` and authenticate the connector, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Log into the JobProgress frontend

Log into the JobProgress frontend as an administrative user.

### 2. Locate the JobProgress developer  settings

Navigate to the **Settings** area for the logged in account. In this section, you will find an area for **Developers**.

### 3. Generate a token

In the **Developer** area, click on the **Generate Token** button. This will create a new `Access Token` with the given name. Save this token for later use.

### 4. Authenticate the connector

You can now use the `Access Token` to authenticate your JobProgress connector.

Your JobProgress connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

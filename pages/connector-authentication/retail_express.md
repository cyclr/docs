## Partner Setup

To access the API, you will need to contact support to request a client code (GUID) and unique URL. 

#### Retrieving Authentication Details

You can access the client ID by hovering over "Help & Support" on the web interface and click "What's my Client ID". 

### Cyclr Setup

Setup your Retail Express App within Cyclr:

*   Go to your **Cyclr Console**
*   Click the **Connectors** menu along the top
*   Choose Connector Library
*   Scroll down to **Retail Express**
*   Click the **Setup** button

Enter the following values:

**Client ID**: The client ID that we retrieved from the web interface.

**Username**: The username you use to login to the Retail Express account on the website.

**Password**: The password you use to login to the Retail Express account on the website.

**Unique URL**: The unique URL you received from contact support.


Your Retail Express Connector is now setup! You can test it by installing it in one of your Cyclr accounts and executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

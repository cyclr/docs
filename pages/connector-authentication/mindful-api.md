## Mindful API setup

You need the following details to install the Mindful API connector into a Cyclr account:

- The **client secret** of your Mindful account.

If you need help to obtain these values, contact the Mindful support team.

## Cyclr setup

### Console setup

To set up your Mindful API connector, go to your Cyclr console:

1. Select **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library** at the top of the page.
2. Use the search box to find the **Mindful API** connector.
3. Select the **Setup Required** icon.
4. Enter the below values, a value here will allow you to use a different value for each installation within an account:
5. 
    | Value             | Description                                    |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | **Client ID**     | The client ID of your Mindful API account.     |
    | **Client Secret** | The client secret of your Mindful API account. |

6. Select **Save Changes**.

> **Note**: To use different settings for different accounts, leave the value blank. This means Cyclr asks you to enter the value when you install the connector into an account.

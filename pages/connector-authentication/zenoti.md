### Setting up the Zenoti Connector

This is completed by your customer using their own information.

They will need their account name, e.g. if their log in URL is 'https://mycompany.zenoti.com/SignIn.aspx' this will be 'mycompany'.

This should be entered in the Client ID field.

Client Secret should be left empty.

They will then be asked to sign in, and the Zenoti Connector will be authenticated!

---

In order to set up OAuth 2 in Zendesk log in to your account and go to `Admin -> API -> OAuth Clients` and click the `+` button to setup a new OAuth application.

Once you have entered the required information and clicked `Save` you will be shown a Secret.

You will need to copy both your Unique Identifier and Secret that were created during this setup - into the Client ID and Client Secret fields - in the Zendesk Connector setup in Cyclr - respectively.

### HubSpot Setup

For Cyclr to connect with the HubSpot API you will need to create an "App" within HubSpot, as detailed below:

  > Note: This part can be completed once, by a Cyclr Partner.  The client/customer does not need their own separate App within HubSpot.

1. Login to the HubSpot Developer Portal [here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-v2/developers)
2. Follow the HubSpot [documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-an-app-in-hubspot) to create an application
3. In the `Auth` tab you will see a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.  Make a note of these to use in Cyclr's Connector setup.
4. The Redirect URL that creates the link between your Cyclr Console and HubSpot is shown on the page where the Client ID and Client Secret are entered.  It has the form
`https://[Your Cyclr Service Domain]/connector/callback`
5. It's not necessary to set Scopes at this point - see next section for details on this.

### Scopes

As mentioned above - it's not necessary to set scopes at this point. The default scopes of `crm.objects.contacts.read` && `crm.objects.contacts.write` will be requested by the Cyclr Connector if you leave the input empty. 
If you input your own scope-list, this will override the default values. 

#### IMPORTANT NOTE (November 2021)
The way that HubSpot handles contact scopes has recently changed:

[https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/oauth/contacts-scope-migration](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/oauth/contacts-scope-migration)

This should not affect you if you have set up a new HubSpot App, but contact Cyclr Support if you have any questions.

If you have an _existing_ HubSpot app this is likely to have been auto-migrated by HubSpot in early November 2021.  This shouldn't affect your integrations, but we'd recommend upgrading your Account Connector to the latest version at your earliest opportunity.


### Permissions

In order to use the Products and Line Items methods, the user must be assigned a [paid Sales Hub seat](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/account/manage-sales-hub-and-service-hub-paid-users) within HubSpot.

### Connector Setup

The Connector now can be installed using the credentials obtained in the above steps:

**Client ID**: `Client ID`

**Secret**: `Client Secret`

**Scopes/Optional**: This defines what permissions will be requested on the consent screen presented to your users.  

By default, all users will be asked to consent to the following permissions/scopes `crm.objects.contacts.read`,`crm.objects.deals.read` and `crm.objects.companies.read`, and where appropriate (these are optional scopes, in other words) users will be asked to consent to ``content`` ``reports`` ``e-commerce`` ``forms``.

Should you need to request *alternative* scopes/optional scopes, this is where you would set them.

You will then be prompted to log in, select your HubSpot and authorize access to the connector.

### Account Selection

When authenticating the HubSpot Connector and signing into HubSpot, the user will be presented with the HubSpot **Choose an Account** screen.

During testing, you should select your main HubSpot account, rather than your developer account.  You can identify the main account by looking for the one with items shown under the "PRODUCTS" heading as shown below.

In this example, that would be the "Cyclr" account:

### Connector Parameters 

Useful if accessing this Connector via the API.  Property Names given here are in the same format as they should be passed to the API.

| Property Name   | Description    |
| ----------- | -----------    |
| Scopes      | The scopes of the connector. Default value is `crm.objects.contacts.read`,`crm.objects.deals.read`,`crm.objects.companies.read`. |
| OptionalScopes   | The optional scopes of the connector. Default value is "content reports e-commerce forms" |


### Webhook Setup
Hubspot webhooks utilise a single webhook URL, this requires some configuration of your Hubspot application.

Navigate to Cyclr Console > Connectors > Application Connector Library > Hubspot > Setup

Copy the Webhook URL to your clipboard. e.g. ```https://<yourserivcedomain>/api/partnerwebhook/xxxxxx``` (Note:do not user the webhook url from the builder, but this one under the partner console)

You will now need to setup the Hubspot application to send webhooks. This has three steps:
 1. Enter the URL
 2. Select events to subscribe to
 3. Activate the events

1
* Navigate to the Hubspot Developers App [Dashboard](https://app.hubspot.com/developer), and select the application you use with Cyclr.
* Within this application, navigate to Webhooks.
* Paste the Webhook URL from your clipboard, into the "target URL"
* Click Save (bottom of screen)

2
* Click Create Subscription
* Select the objects and events that you wish to send to Cyclr
* Click Subscribe

3
* Under event subscriptions 
* Hover over the line with mouse and view subscriptions button will be shown, click this button
* Hover over the line with mouse and  activate" button will be shown, click this button to activate the sending of the webhook

Your application is now set up for Webhooks using Cyclr.

Webhook Usage
* Drag the Webhook step from the sidebar into the Builder.
* Connect the Webhook to another step.
* Click Run to start the Cycle.

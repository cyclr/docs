# Partner Setup
-------------
Cyclr requires Pipedrive to use OAuth 2.0 authentication for remote API access. You must register Cyclr within Pipedrive as its own App to receive a Client ID and Client Secret. This enables Cyclr to authenticate and connect with Pipedrive.

> Note: Due to how Pipedrive authentication works, customers themselves will need to follow the below Pipedrive setup process.

## Pipedrive Setup

To obtain Client ID and Client Secret values from within Pipedrive:

### Enable a Developer Sandbox Account

To create a Developer Sandbox Account, Pipedrive requires you to complete the following [form](https://developers.pipedrive.com/start-here). This allows you to access the **Marketplace Manager**. Without this, you will be unable to create the Pipedrive App required for authentication with Cyclr. The official Pipedrive documentation on this process can be found [here](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/developer-sandbox-account).

### Create an app within the Marketplace Manager

Create a new App and obtain the Client ID and Client Secret using the steps below. The official Pipedrive documentation for creating an App can be found [here](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-creating-a-proper-app).

1. Go to the **Marketplace Manager** found [here](https://cyclrdevs.pipedrive.com/settings/marketplace_manager). This is only accessible if you have a Developer Sandbox Account as explained above.
2. Click `Create New App`.
3. Select `No` to set the App to unlisted and internal/private, then click `Next`. Pipedrive's documentation on app types can be found [here](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-creating-a-proper-app#types-of-apps).
4. Complete the App form as required by Pipedrive.
5. Cyclr authentication is handled under the **OAuth & Access scopes** heading. Enter the callback URL in the **Callback URL** field. The callback URL has the following format:
   https://{{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}}/connector/callback
6. Enable the required **Access scopes** as either **Read only** or **Full access**. The official Pipedrive documentation on access scopes can be found [here](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations).
7. Click `Save` to create the App. This will take you back to the Marketplace Manager.
8. Click the newly created App within the **Marketplace Manager** to be taken to the settings again. Under the **OAuth & Access scopes** heading you will now find the **Client ID** and can click `Show` to reveal the **Client secret**. Make a note of these as they will be required by Cyclr to set up the Pipedrive Connector.

## Cyclr Setup

To set up the Pipedrive Connector within Cyclr:

1. Go to the **Cyclr Console**.
2. Click the `Connectors` dropdown menu at the top of the page.
3. Click `Application Connector Library`.
4. Use the search bar to find the **Pipedrive (OAuth2.0)** App.
5. Click the **Setup Required** button.
6. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** found in the previous section and click `Next`.
7. Click `Sign In` to sign in to Pipedrive to allow Cyclr to connect to it.
8. Click `Allow and Install` to authorize the Pipedrive App to use the listed permissions and install it to your account.

Your Pipedrive Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

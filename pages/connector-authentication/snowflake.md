# Snowflake set up

You need the following information to set up the Snowflake connector in Cyclr:

-   The [client ID and client](#getting-the-client-id-and-client-secret) secret obtained by [creating a security integration](#creating-a-secutiry-integration) in Snowflake.
-   The [account identifier](#getting-the-account-identifier) associated with your Snowflake account.

### Creating a security integration

You need to create a security integration in Snowflake to [get the client ID and client secret](#getting-the-client-id-and-client-secret). You can find Snowflake's guide on creating a security integration in the Snowflake console [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration.html#snowflake-oauth). The following example creates a security integration called `cyclr_oauth` that issues a refresh token once per day:

```sql
create or replace security integration
    cyclr_oauth
    TYPE = OAUTH
    ENABLED = TRUE
    OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
    OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = CONFIDENTIAL
    OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://example.cyclr.com/connector/callback'
    OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
    OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 86400;
```

**Note**: The `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` field must point to the OAuth redirect URL of your Cyclr account. This has the format: `https://{Your Cyclr service domain e.g. app-h.cyclr.com}/connector/callback`.

### Getting the client ID and client secret

You need a client ID and client secret to authenticate the Snowflake connector in Cyclr. Before you can get these you need to [create a security integration](#creating-a-secutiry-integration). You can find Snowflake's guide on getting the client ID and client secret in the Snowflake console [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_show_oauth_client_secrets.html). The following example gets the client ID and client secret for the security integration created in the previous section:

```sql
select system$show_oauth_client_secrets('CYCLR_OAUTH');
```

**Note**: The integration name `cyclr_oauth` is converted to upper case and you need to enter `CYCLR_OAUTH` instead for this request.

### Getting the account identifier

You need your account identifier to authenticate the Snowflake connector in Cyclr. Your account identifier is the subdomain in your Snowflake account URL provided on account creation. This is the same URL that you use to log in to Snowflake. For example, the account URL `https://AB12345.europe-west1.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com` has the account identifier `AB12345.europe-west1.gcp`.

### Console setup

To set up your Snowflake connector within your Cyclr console:

1. Go to your **Cyclr Console**.
2. Select **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library** at the top of the page.
3. Use the search box to find the Snowflake connector.
4. Select the **Setup Required** icon.
5. Enter the below values, omitting this step will allow you to use different settings for each account on installation:
    - **Client ID**: The [client ID](#getting-the-client-id-and-client-secret) of your Snowflake account.
    - **Client Secret**: The [client secret](#getting-the-client-id-and-client-secret) of your Snowflake account.
6. Select **Save Changes**.

### Account setup

You will be asked for the following values when installing the Snowflake connector within an account:

-   **Client ID**: The client ID of your Snowflake account, if you did not enter this in step 5 above.
-   **Client Secret**: The client secret of your Snowflake account, if you did not enter this in step 5 above.
-   **Account Identifier**: The [account identifier](#getting-the-account-identifier) of your Snowflake account.
-   **Warehouse**: The Snowflake warehouse to process queries with.
-   **Database**: The Snowflake database to access data in.
-   **Schema**: The Snowflake schema to access data in.

Your Snowflake connector is now set up! You can test it by executing one of the methods to confirm it can return some data.

**Note**: You can install the connector without providing a warehouse, database, and schema and use methods in the `Utilities` category to list accessible warehouses, databases, and schemas.

# Creating custom Table Rows objects

You can create custom `Table Rows` objects to have methods specific to a Snowflake table. This will automatically populate request and response fields for methods within the custom object. To create a custom object:

1. Go to the **Edit Connector** page for the Snowflake connector.
2. Under the **Methods & Fields** heading, locate the **Table Rows** category and select it to expand.
3. Select the red **Copy this Category to create a Custom Object Category** icon.
4. Use the dropdown menu to select the Snowflake table name.
5. Select **Copy**.

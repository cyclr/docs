# Retain.me setup

To authenticate the Retain.me connector, you will need multiple authentication details to authenticate the different Retain.me APIs. These credentials will be needed depending on which API you wish to use:

* DC API Username and Password
* Orders API Username and Password
* SMART Returns API Username and Password

## Authenticate the connector
To set up the Retain.me connector in Cyclr, go to your **Cyclr Console**.

1. Select **Connectors** > **Application Connector Library** at the top of the page.

2. Use the search box to find the **Retain.me** connector.

3. Select the **Setup** icon.

4. Enter your Username and Password for each API you wish to use in the connector.. 

5. Select **Save Changes**.


Each API has a category of methods within the connector, and these will require their corresponding username and password to be entered in the connector set-up page. Each set of credentials are optional if you are not using the corresponding API in the connector.

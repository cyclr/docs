# Synchtank Setup #

To authenticate the Synchtank connector you will need the following pieces of information:

* Domain for your API instance.
* A valid API key.

If you do not have access to these, please contact Synchtank to gather the correct credentials. This can be done [here](https://www.synchtank.com/solutions/).

### Authenticate your connector ###
1. Install the Synchtank connector and go to **Setup**. 
2. Enter the Domain to your given API instance in the URL box of the **Connector Setup**. This is the string after `https://` in your URL. Click next.
3. Enter your API key. Click next.

Your Synchtank Connector is now set up! You can test it by installing it to one of your Cyclr accounts and using one of the methods to confirm it returns data.

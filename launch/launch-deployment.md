title: Launch Deployment

To enable your users to add an integration, simply present a “Connect” button or link within your application’s UI.

For example:

![Generic Host Application](./images/generic-host-app.png)

When a user clicks the “Connect” button, your application server should make a request towards Cyclr’s REST API’s _/users/launch_ method:

{% raw %}
curl -X POST \\
\-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS\_TOKEN}" \\
\-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
\-H "Accept: application/json"

\-d '{ \\
 "Username": "user@example.com", \\ 
 "Password": "password", \\ 
 "AccountId": "7047269e-9d36-4918-b28a-2f7b1100e998", \\ 
 "partnerConnector": {

 "Name": "Connector Name", \\

 "Version": "1.0", \\

 "AuthValue": "NJ88GGgv79V79VvYFBBTHUIGYBGY3434345545UYu", \\

 "Properties": \[

 {"Name": "Url", "Value": "[https://myapp.something.blah](https://myapp.something.blah)"}

 \] \\

 }
}' \\
"https://api.cyclr.com/v1.0/users/launch"
{% endraw %}

You should use a Cyclr Partner OAuth token as the Bearer token in this request.

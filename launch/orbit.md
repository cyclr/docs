title: Launch Orbit
---

ORBIT is LAUNCH’s companion, giving your users a screen where they can view their installed integrations as well as pause and delete them.

As a prepackaged integration management solution ORBIT is deployed in a similar fashion to LAUNCH, being made accessible to your users via a pop up, model or iframe.

ORBIT’s styling and layout can also be customised from within the Cyclr Console. You can set your own custom HTML and CSS in **Settings > Appearance Settings**

    <tr>
        <td>Password</td>
        <td>The password to assign to the new Cyclr user account, if created.

    <tr>
        <td>AccountId</td>
        <td>If your user already has an account within Cyclr, specify the Id of that account to have the new integration installed there rather than a new Cyclr account.</td>
